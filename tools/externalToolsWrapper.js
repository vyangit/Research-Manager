/**
 * externalToolsWrapper.js
 * 
 * Wrappers for calling desktop scripts and an interface for streaming datasets in and out of the browser
 * This concept is currently conceptual and is left here for inspiration. The overall work to implement this function may be excess and unnecessary.
 * 
 * These approaches require the user to be software/tech proficient to a certain degree.  
 * Approach 1: Link the extension with the desktop console (security issues will likely be raised)
 * Approach 2: Provide the the storage src path or include a python/r wrapper api library to query the data
